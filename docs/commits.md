## Hourly Development Progress

### Hour 0-1: Project Initialization & Setup
**Phase**: Initial Setup

**Commits**:
- `Initial commit: Project scaffolding`
- `Add gitignore and package.json`
- `Setup Express server and basic structure`

**Changes Made**:
- Created project directory structure
- Initialized npm project with dependencies
- Set up Express.js server boilerplate
- Configured environment variables structure
- Created basic folder organization (models, routes, controllers, services)

**AI Prompts Used**:
- "Generate the initial project scaffolding: Backend: Express app with MongoDB Atlas connection, Student model, and auth routes"

**Key Decisions**:
- Chose Express.js for backend (familiar, lightweight)
- Decided on MVC architecture with services layer
- Selected EJS for templating (simpler than React for this scope)

---

### Hour 2-3: Database Setup & Models
**Phase**: Database Configuration

**Commits**:
- `Add MongoDB connection configuration`
- `Create User model with bcrypt integration`
- `Create Student model with schema validation`
- `Add pre-save hooks for calculated fields`

**Changes Made**:
- Connected to MongoDB Atlas
- Implemented User model with password hashing
- Created Student schema with all required fields
- Added automatic calculation middleware for cgpaPercentage and overallPercentage
- Set up proper validation rules (min/max, enums)

**AI Prompts Used**:
- "Create a Student model with fields: name, branch (enum), isHosteller (boolean), cgpa, attendance, with calculated fields"

**Technical Highlights**:
- Used Mongoose pre-save hooks for automatic calculations
- Implemented proper schema validation
- Added timestamps for audit trail

---

### Hour 4-5: Authentication System
**Phase**: Security Implementation

**Commits**:
- `Implement JWT authentication service`
- `Add register and login controllers`
- `Create authentication middleware`
- `Add cookie-parser for session management`

**Changes Made**:
- Built complete authentication service with JWT
- Implemented bcrypt password hashing
- Created protected route middleware
- Set up HTTP-only secure cookies
- Added login page UI

**AI Prompts Used**:
- "Add authentication system: Register and login routes, bcrypt for passwords, JWT tokens, protect student CRUD routes"

**Security Measures**:
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- JWT tokens with 1-hour expiration
- HTTP-only cookies (prevent XSS)
- Secure flag for production environment

---

### Hour 6-8: Student CRUD Operations
**Phase**: Core Functionality

**Commits**:
- `Add student service layer with CRUD operations`
- `Create student controller with all endpoints`
- `Implement student routes with protection`
- `Add form validation and error handling`

**Changes Made**:
- Built complete CRUD functionality:
  - Create: POST /students/add
  - Read: GET /students (with pagination)
  - Update: POST /students/edit/:id
  - Delete: POST /students/delete/:id
- Implemented service layer for business logic
- Added proper error handling
- Created form validation

**AI Prompts Used**:
- "Generate Express routes for Create, Read, Update, Delete students using Mongoose"

**Architecture Decision**:
- Separated concerns: Controllers → Services → Models
- Services contain business logic
- Controllers handle HTTP requests/responses
- Models define data structure

---

### Hour 9-11: Pagination, Filtering & Search
**Phase**: Data Management Features

**Commits**:
- `Add pagination to student listing`
- `Implement branch filter functionality`
- `Add name search with case-insensitive regex`
- `Create sorting for multiple columns`

**Changes Made**:
- Pagination: 6 items per page with skip/limit
- Filter: Branch enum filter with dropdown
- Search: Name-based search (case-insensitive)
- Sorting: Name, branch, cgpa, overallPercentage (ascending/descending)
- URL parameter preservation across navigation

**AI Prompts Used**:
- "Enhance the Student list API with: Pagination (5-10 items per page), Filter by branch, Sorting by CGPA and search by name"

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Example: Pagination + Filter + Sort
const query = { branch: 'CSE' };
const students = await Student.find(query)
    .sort('-cgpa')
    .skip((page - 1) * limit)
    .limit(limit);
```

**UI Components**:
- Login form with error display
- Data table with sortable headers
- Form with all required fields
