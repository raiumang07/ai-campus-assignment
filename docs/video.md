## Video Script & Timeline

### Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**Script**:
> "Hello! I'm Umang Rai, and this is my submission for the AI Campus Assignment. Over the past 24 hours, I built a full-stack Student Management System with authentication, CRUD operations, and advanced features like filtering, sorting, and search. The application is deployed live at ai-campus-assignment-l9w4.onrender.com. Let me walk you through the key features."

**Screen**: Show the login page with animated background

**Actions to Demonstrate**:
1. Show the login page design
2. Attempt login with wrong credentials → show error message
3. Login successfully with correct credentials
4. Explain cookie-based session management
5. Show redirect to student dashboard

**Key Points to Mention**:
- JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Protected routes requiring authentication
- Session expiry after 1 hour
