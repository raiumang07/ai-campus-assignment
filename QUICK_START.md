## 🔧 Troubleshooting for Reviewers

### If Live Site Won't Load:
- Check internet connection
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Clear browser cache
- Wait 30 seconds (Render free tier may need to wake up)

### If Login Fails:
- Create new user via Postman register endpoint
- Check credentials are correct
- Ensure cookies are enabled in browser

### If Postman Tests Fail:
- Update baseUrl variable to live URL
- Ensure you've run register → login first
- Check cookie is being saved automatically

### If Local Setup Fails:
- Verify Node.js version (18+)
- Check MongoDB connection string in .env
- Ensure all npm packages installed
- Verify .env file is in backend/ directory
